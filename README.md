# 🚀 Preface
When I was in high school, I wasn’t sure if I wanted to major in mechanical engineering or computer science. By junior year, I decided on mechanical engineering because I didn't *“want to be up until 4:00am trying to find a bug in my code”*. While that statement was naïve in retrospect, I still believe that mechanical engineering was the correct choice. However, I’ve routinely wondered how my college career would have played out differently if I had chosen computer science.  

Aside from normal college shenanigans, a large chunk of my free time during college has been working on computer science passion projects. This meant learning full-stack web development, JavaScript frameworks, game development, graphics programming, and so on. These projects were useful for building skills in the short term, but due to my lack of foundational knowledge none of these skills ever stuck fully. This has resulted in a knowledgebase that is more akin to haphazardly placed support beams than a concrete foundation.
### 💼 Career Development
This all came to ahead about a month ago (October 2023 as I’m writing this) when I started to apply to internships for the summer before my senior year. One objective of my continued self-education of computer science has always been to open more career opportunities for myself in the future, specifically in CS. This means that if I chose to, I could shift from an engineering industry to a software industry, or some adjacent industry. Unfortunately, applying to software engineering internships has made me realize that I don’t possess all the skills to meet the criteria, nor pass the coding interviews for them. 

I decided that the best course of action for my situation would be to pad out my foundational knowledge and skills, learn about more advanced topics in CS, and reach a level that is competitive with those pursuing a degree in CS. My intentions with Open-Source Society University are to provide myself with a self-guided formal education to achieve these goals.
### ⏰ Statement of Commitment
*I intend to commit 20 hours a week, or slightly less than 3 hours every day to learning computer science. This number is intended to be an average, and it is acceptable if the hours I spend on OSSU vary by day. However, I do intend to take at least 30 minutes every day if possible.*

## 🔙 Retrospective
Part of what makes CS50 Introduction to Programming with Python so great is Professor David J. Malan’s ability to teach programming concepts clearly and concisely. One problem I have encountered with many teachers is that they assume their students have a certain level of prerequisite knowledge. This prevents the teacher from fully communicating a topic to their students, due to a lack of parity in implicit knowledge between the students and the teacher. Malan has the unique ability to approach computer science from the outside perspective of a programming novice, despite his own expert proficiency with computer science. His stress on incremental improvement of code and reliance of building off previously taught concepts make his lectures easily digestible even from a CS outsider. His high energy 💥 and passion during lectures made me more excited to learn programming than I have been in a long time.  

Malan uses Python as a tool to teach programming, not to teach Python. Python is treated as a medium to learn programming concepts, and the language is taught along the way as a side effect. This was a sharp deviation from the Introduction to Programming for Non-Majors course I took at my university. That course tunnel visioned on the Python language and expected the student to learn programming concepts along the way. CS50 was able to teach me much more, to greater effect, despite it being online and asynchronous.
### 💡 What I Learned
Given my previous experience with programming I did not expect to learn much, but boy was I wrong. I routinely found myself learning new concepts and having gaps in my knowledge filled. For example, I now know the difference between function parameters and arguments (Yes, really). I was genuinely surprised how much content is crammed into the course’s 10 lectures (And three mini-lectures). The topics covered are diverse, practical, and foundational for further education in computer science. Malan starts by teaching basics like variables, conditionals, loops, and functions. The content quickly accelerates to cover APIs, data persistence, regular expressions, and so on. Despite the large selection of topics covered, I never once felt overwhelmed by new information. In addition, the homework felt like an opportunity to put what was learned in class into practice rather than busy work.
### 👎 Dislikes
My one, probably unfair, nitpick is the lectures are not a consistent length. Lectures could vary from 50 minutes all the way to 170 minutes in length. Maybe I just have a short attention span 🤷.
### 🤔 Suggestions for Students
Don’t be afraid to pause the lectures and go slow. You will learn much more if you code along with Malan during lectures and take notes on important points. Conversely, don’t be afraid to go off the rails and try to predict what Malan will write if you feel confident. One great part of this course is that it encourages you to learn through experimentation.
## 🔑 *Key Takeaways*
* Part of good programming is trying to find a balance between compactness and readability.
* Don’t try to write a program all at once. Incremental progress is important for catching bugs in one’s code and improving it over time.
* Testing code with unit tests is important to confirm that the overall functionality of a function doesn’t change, even if the code inside the function does change.
